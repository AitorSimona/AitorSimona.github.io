intro: I have always loved games, up to the point of being told not to play so much. Some years ago, a stroke of luck or just fate gave me the opportunity to dedicate myself to creating what I had always loved. There is always a lot of stuff to learn, and when you open a door 3 more appear, it is thrilling!
outro: I program mainly in C/C++, but I have touched C# and Python too. I have used Unity, both as a reference for my own game engine and other different projects. Gameplay/AI programming are my current passion and above all being involved in videogames.
