intro: I have always loved games, up to the point of being told not to play so much. Some years ago, a stroke of luck or just fate gave me the opportunity to dedicate myself to creating what I had always loved. There is always a lot of stuff to learn, and when you open a door 3 more appear, it is thrilling!
outro: I program mainly in C/C++/C#, but I have touched others such as Python too. I have developed my custom game engine in C++ (and a game on it) and also worked in many projects using Unity and Unreal Engine. Right now I work in R6 Siege at Ubisoft. Gameplay/AI programming are my current passion and above all being involved in videogames.
