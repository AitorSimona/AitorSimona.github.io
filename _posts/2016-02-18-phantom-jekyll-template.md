lead_text: "3D Game Engine built from scratch in C++ during the length of the "Engines" subject at CITM - UPC (up to version 0.3). The main focus was to build and understand a 3D engine's main systems. I used several libraries such as OpenGL, Glew, ImGui, SDL, JSON for modern C++... For a complete list, check "View Project" below!!

After 0.3, everything was done during my holidays, twofold purpose:
- Having fun, learning.
- Preparing stuff for Project 3 subject in CITM Barcelona (2020).

It was one of the most entertaining and fun projects I have ever been involved in, and maybe the most challenging one, but it wouldn't be interesting otherwise, right? It was thought to be done in groups of two people, but I decided to do it alone so I could touch every single part of the game engine. It meant I had twice the work but it was worth it!!
